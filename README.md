### A 5-Year Story of Healthcare Labor Across the U.S. (Excel Dashboard Project)

📊 *Dashboard Tool:* Microsoft Excel  
📅 *Data Range:* 2009 - 2013  
📍 *Focus Area:* U.S. Healthcare Labor Analysis  
🔎 *Goal:* Understand how healthcare labor hours are distributed across control types and job roles in U.S. healthcare facilities, and how that evolved over time.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project tells a visual story of healthcare labor in the U.S. across five years using Excel. It highlights how different control types (e.g., Non-Profit, Investor-Owned, City/County) manage healthcare labor resources, where the most hours are spent, and how productivity shifted from 2009 to 2013.

The dashboard provides a holistic view of healthcare operations — from staffing hours per patient to facility distribution by control type.

## 🔍 What I Discovered (Key Insights)

### 1. *Non-profit Institutions Are the Workforce Backbone*
- Account for *71.7%* of total labor hours — the highest among all control types.
- Central to healthcare workforce delivery in the U.S.

### 2. *Non-Profit Facilities Dominate the System*
- *19,635 facilities* recorded — far ahead of other types.
- Suggests healthcare infrastructure is largely supported by the nonprofit sector.

### 3. *Registered Nurses and Daily Cost Centers Are the Busiest Roles*
- Both average *8 hours per adjusted patient day*.
- Indicates care-heavy resource allocation at the point of service.

### 4. *Efficiency Improved Over Time*
- From 3.12 to 3.8 hours per adjusted patient day (2009 to 2013).
- More work done per patient day over the years — rising productivity.

### 5. *Santa Clara & San Francisco Counties Lead Labor Contribution*
- Recorded the highest productive labor hours over 5 years.
- Smaller counties lag behind in resource allocation.

## 🤔 Why This Matters

- *Healthcare labor* is one of the largest cost and impact areas in the system.
- Understanding which roles and facility types consume the most hours helps shape *staffing policies, **training, and **resource planning*.
- County-level insights help policymakers address *labor shortages* or inefficiencies regionally.

## ✅ Recommendations Based on Analysis

1. *Invest in High-Impact Roles*  
   Registered nurses and cost centers account for the most hours — optimize scheduling and staffing support for these roles.

2. *Support City/County Facilities*  
   As they provide the majority of workforce hours, they need consistent funding, training pipelines, and retention programs.

3. *Reduce Gaps in Lower-Performing Counties*  
   Encourage cross-county support or resource redistribution where counties like Mariposa or Yuba lag behind.

4. *Use Labor Trends to Guide Funding*  
   Since labor hours and productivity are rising, budget models should scale alongside to match growing operational effort.

## 🔮 Predictive Outlook

If these 5-year trends continue:

- *City/County control types* will continue to dominate labor output, requiring robust staffing infrastructure.
- *Nursing roles* will remain a top labor priority — emphasizing the need for retention and education.
- *Smaller counties* may fall further behind unless regional support systems are implemented.
